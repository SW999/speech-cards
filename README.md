## Problem

Many people, like me, experience anxiety or even fear when preparing for public speaking. The reasons can be different and there are many ways to defeat such a fear.

Moreover, I noticed that from excitement I can forget part of the speech that I had learned and practised well before.

There are many simple techniques to deal with this problem. The easiest way is to prepare cards with a sequence of words or phrases that correspond to the particular sections of the speech. **Speech cards**.


## How it works?
After you have prepared well your public speech, you may need a little helper in order not to lose the thread and be more confident.

You may prepare such helper in some pieces of paper by pen **or** using [this simple app](https://sw999.github.io/speech-cards/). In the latter case, **your mobile phone will be your assistant!**

To do this you need create a new speech and save it.
Now it will be available in 2 versions: in the "**My speeches**" section from the browser local storage and as a separate file with the **JSON** extension.

## Advantages:

- Could be easily used on a mobile device to create, store and use speech cards.
- No way to lose or forget your speech cards, because your mobile device is always with you. Am I right?
- You may easily share prepared speech cards in JSON format with someone or to open it in a different device.

## Tips:

- Each card should be as simple as possible,
- Should contain short clear heading,
- Should contain main idea/ideas of current part of speech.
